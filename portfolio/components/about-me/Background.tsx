            Growing up in Bras√≠lia, the modernist architectural capital of
            Brazil, my home was a fusion of creativity and analytical thinking,
            influenced by my father&lsquo;s career as a photographer and my
            mother&lsquo;s profession as a lawyer. This unique blend has deeply
            shaped my perspective.

            My fascination with technology began at age four, sparked by our
            trusty beige computer. Although I pursued a degree in Computer
            Science, my true passion lies in the transformative power of great
            design craft, mainly inspired by the design craftsmanship behind
            Apple products.

          <p className="py-5">
            My curiosity led me to wonder: could I also create something that
            can evoke this effect on people?
          </p>
          <p className="py-5">
            Today, I apply my multidisciplinary design skills, aiming to create
            solutions that make people feel and remember, elevating everyday
            experiences into inspiring solutions.
